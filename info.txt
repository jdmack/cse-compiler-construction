To Do
-----

Check #1 - Need to set isModifiable and isAddressable
Possible bug in rc.cup:
    Designator2:_1 T_LPAREN OptExprList T_RPAREN
        DoFuncCall but RESULT is set to _1 instead of the result of FuncCall
    Same for DoAssignExpr
    

Need to handle ConstSTO values
For Check #2, array's are not modifiable L-vals yet
For Check #3, there are other assignments in grammar not being assigned
    - Also, only did int->float assignability

Make sure action code is in the best place

For Check #5, two more complicated ReturnType instances not handled

I am returning STO's for stmt's that don't require it, but there isn't anything technically wrong with not using a return value, so doing it anyways to be consistent
