CSE 131
==============

Quarter project for CSE 131: Compiler Construction.

Performs semantic analysis on the Reduced-C langage and compiles to binary for Sparc 32-bit systems.

Due to the excessive time requirements of the course in conjunction with having to work minimum 20 hours a week and 
commute 26 miles to school at the time of taking this class, the compiler is not complete or bug free.

* Note to Students: If you are reading this to steal my code, you should realize that if you do not know how to get 
to the state where my code is, you will not know enough to finish it. But hey, have at it if you really want to.
